NetGear SC101 reverse engineered protocol

WARNING: This is old and unfinished code.

Supports device discovery, enumeration of disks and partitions.
There was some attempt to implement file reading and writing as network block device,
but the project was cancelled and I didn't have the device anymore, so I had no way 
to continue the project. Realising this code so maybe someone would find it useful.
